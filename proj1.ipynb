For example, participants with only \"Some high school\" education are almost always predicted to have a low cognitive performance, whereas participants with \"Some college\" education or \"College degree\" are usually predicted to have high cognitive performance. Nevertheless, educational level seems not to be as strong a predictor for cognitive performance as age, especially for certain educational levels. For example, participants with \"Master's degree\" can be predicted to have either a low or high cognitive performance according to the information on the second graph, depending on the split at ancester nodes according to age.\n","\n","- sometimes also uses **gender** to split data, but far less frequently compared to age and educational level. Additionally, it is also not as predictive for cognitive performance as age and educational level. For example, in the first graph, after splitting by gender, there are participants predicted (further by age and educational level) to have both high and low coginitive performance within each gender class; and in the second graph, after splitting according to age and educational level, further splitting by gender does not lead to different cognitive performance prediction by gender.\n","\n","- rarely uses **country** to split data; and when the model does use country, it does not lead to different cognitive performance prediction by country.
